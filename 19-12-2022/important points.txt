Properties in c# :	with the help of getter and setter we can restrict the user to manipulate the important information just like we can make the variable readonly by defining get property only 
		  	so the user cannot change intially assign value or we can make the variable writeonly by defining set property only so user cannot print the original assign value.
		  	Also we can give conditions bt using if-else flow control statements in setter to give permission to user to change the initial values in certain conditions.

Collections:	Non-Generic collections are the auto resizing collection but they are not type safe which means we can store differnt data types values in a one collection like ArrayList or HashTable and this is the main disadvantage while working with the Non-Generic collections
	    	to get avoid this disadvantage we can use the Generic collections in which we can use Listand Dictionary to store the values of specified type which we can declare while intilizing the collection. In Dictionary we can also declare the type of the key.
	   	Generic collection allow us to use class as a type in List collection where we can store different variables for different attributes and all ther information can be saved in List collection.

Array:	Array is a Collection of similar data type values but the are not autyo resizing means while creating an array we have to declare the size of that array and onc ethe array is created we cannot change the original size of that array.

MultiDimensional Array:  MultiDimensional array means the array of arrays. Arrays are basically a collection which store the values of a specified data type and the multidimensional array is the  collection which store the arrays which stores some values in it.
			In 2D array there are basically two things one is Row and second is column , so when declairintg the 2D array the first array is point towards the rows and second array point towards the column.
			When printing the values of 2D array we have to use two for loops in which 2nd loop is nested inside the first one.The first for loop is usede to point the values of the first array which helps to find the location of the value and simultaneously the for loop which is nested indicate the value which want to store.

Jagged Array:   In multiDimensional array the number of rows and the number of columns are fixed but in some conditions while storing the date the number of rows are fixed but the number of the colums are not fixed at that time the Multi dimensional arrays are useful so we use jagged array.

Extension Methods:  If the project is ready and tested successfully and the if there is some extra features are want to add in the project there is one senario where we can add this features in that project is Inheritance,
		    but if there is also some conditions where we cannot apply Inheritance like Sealed class or the original type is not class may be it's a structure, at this point we use one mechanism of adding new methods into an existing class or structure also without modifying the source code
		    of the original type and this process we don't require any permission from original type and the original type doesn't require any re-compilation. This mechanism is called Extension Methods.	                   
		    For adding the methods into the class or structure first we have to createa one static class in which add all the methods and after that bind that class to the class which is present in project where you want to add the features.
		    For binding the method witha class use a this keyword in the method parameter with the class name and the object of that class.
